# Meteoroid Atmospheric Entry & Strewn Field Simulation

This project provides a numerical model of small near-Earth asteroid (meteoroid) entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.  
The code simulates the main phases of atmospheric flight:

- **Fireball phase** – high-velocity entry, drag, heating, and ablation.  
- **Fragmentation** – breakup when aerodynamic loads exceed the body’s strength.  
- **Dark flight** – propagation of surviving fragments until they reach the ground.  

From these computations, the model predicts the location of meteorite impacts on the ground (the **strewn field**).
